## Getting Started

To run this project you will need to set your environment variables.

1. Create a new file named `.env` inside the `djcrm` folder
2. Copy all of the variables inside `djcrm/.template.env` and assign your own values to them
3. Run `set READ_DOT_ENV_FILE=True` or `export READ_DOT_ENV_FILE=True` inside your terminal so that your environment variables file will be read.
